The LiveSwitch Hammer CLI lets you run specific automated tests against a LiveSwitch deployment.

Requires .NET Core 3.1 or newer. Requires LiveSwitch Server 1.11.1 or newer.

## Building

Use `dotnet publish` to create a single, self-contained file for a specific platform/architecture:

### Windows
```none
dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release /p:PublishSingleFile=true /p:PublishTrimmed=true -o win
```

### macOS
```none
dotnet publish -r osx-x64 -c Release /p:PublishSingleFile=true /p:PublishTrimmed=true -o osx
```

### Linux
```none
dotnet publish -r linux-x64 -c Release /p:PublishSingleFile=true /p:PublishTrimmed=true -o linux
```

Alternatively, use `dotnet build` to create a platform-agnostic bundle (the .NET Core runtime must be installed):

```none
dotnet build
```

Using this approach will generate a library instead of an executable. Use `dotnet lshammer.dll` instead of `lshammer` to run it.

## Docker

Images are also hosted on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/frozenmountain/liveswitch-hammer).

```shell
docker run --rm frozenmountain/liveswitch-hammer [verb] [options]
```

## Environment Variables

Environment variables can be used in place of command-line arguments.

Environment variable names are `LSHAMMER_{VERB}_{OPTION}`, e.g. `LSHAMMER_SCAN_GATEWAY_URL`.

Variable names must be upper case on all platforms except for Windows. All dashes (`-`) in the OPTION must be replaced with underscores (`_`) as Linux/MacOS don't allow dashes in the environment variable name.

Note that command-line arguments always take precedence over environment variables.

## Usage

```none
lshammer [verb] [options]
```

### Verbs

```none
  cluster    Tests scenarios that evoke clustering edge cases.

  load       Tests parallel and sequential load scenarios.

  scan       Tests individual Media Servers for connectivity and media flow.
```

## cluster

The `cluster` verb connects two clients in parallel to the same channel and then opens two MCU connections concurrently. The content of the media flow is monitored to ensure that the generated sounds and images are sent and received as expected.

This test is intended to be used with multiple Media Servers that cluster together. To ensure this takes place, do either of the following:

1.  Set the Deployment > Clustering > Strategy to `RoundRobin`.
2.  Assign unique regions to the Media Servers and provide them as options to `lshammer`.

```none
  --iteration-count       (Default: 1000) The number of iterations to run.

  --media-timeout         (Default: 5) The number of seconds to wait for media
                          to flow.

  --tag1                 The first client's tag.

  --tag2                 The second client's tag.

  --region1               The first client's region.

  --region2               The second client's region.

  -g, --gateway-url       (Default: http://localhost:8080/sync) The Gateway URL.

  -a, --application-id    (Default: my-app-id) The application identifier.

  -s, --shared-secret     (Default: --replaceThisWithYourOwnSharedSecret--) The
                          shared secret.
```

## load

The `load` verb connects a configurable number of clients to a configurable number of channels, and then opens a configurable number of SFU connections. The degree of parallelism in each of these three stages (client register, channel join, connection open) is configurable.

There are two ways to parallelize the channel join and connection open tasks:

1.  Distribute evenly across channels. This is the default behaviour.
2.  Fill up one channel before moving to the next, enabled by `--channel-burst`.

```none
  --iteration-count       (Default: 1) The number of iterations to run.

  --client-count          (Default: 1) The number of clients to register.

  --channel-count         (Default: 1) The number of channels for each client to
                          join.

  --connection-count      (Default: 1) The number of connections in each channel
                          to open.

  --parallelism           (Default: 1) The number of parallel operations to
                          allow.

  --channel-burst         (Default: false) Group traffic bursts by channel.

  --pause-timeout         (Default: 0) The number of seconds to wait before
                          closing connections.

  -g, --gateway-url       (Default: http://localhost:8080/sync) The Gateway URL.

  -a, --application-id    (Default: my-app-id) The application identifier.

  -s, --shared-secret     (Default: --replaceThisWithYourOwnSharedSecret--) The
                          shared secret.
```

## scan

The `scan` verb connects in sequence to each Media Server in a cluster using various configurations for network traversal. Individual configurations can be disabled as needed for deployments with specific requirements.

For TURNS, certificate expiry can also be tested. If a certificate is expiring within a configurable number of days, an error will be returned.

```none
  --api-key               Required. The API key to authenticate requests.

  --api-base-url          (Default: http://localhost:9090/admin/api) The base
                          URL of the Gateway API service.

  --no-host               (Default: false) Do not test host-only connectivity.

  --no-stun               (Default: false) Do not test STUN-only connectivity.

  --no-turn-udp           (Default: false) Do not test TURN/UDP-only
                          connectivity.

  --no-turn-tcp           (Default: false) Do not test TURN/TCP-only
                          connectivity.

  --no-turns              (Default: false) Do not test TURNS-only connectivity.

  --min-cert-days         (Default: 7) The minimum number of days to allow until
                          certificate expiry.

  --max-attempts          (Default: 3) The max number of attempts for a given
                          Media Server.

  --attempt-interval      (Default: 5) The interval, in seconds, between failed
                          attempts.

  --media-timeout         (Default: 5) The number of seconds to wait for media
                          to flow.

  --tag                   The client's tag.

  --media-server-id       The Media Server to test.
